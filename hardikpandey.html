		suggesting that half of the tournament can <br>
		be won on the auction table . I still believe<br>

		out, I also believe we are witnessing some <br>
		excellent examples of why the auction is only<br>
		50 percent of the equation.<br></th>

		(including me) felt that Gujarat Titans looked <br>
		the weakest of all the teams. On paper,<br>
		they lacked batting fire power and the right<br>
		combinations, and the playoffs looked a<br>
		distant possibility even before Jason Roy <br>
		pulled out of the tournament citing bubble <br>
		fatigue.</th>

		Lucknow Super Giants , recording six wins<br>

		teams. How are they managing this with a <br>
		team that is not so strong on paper?</th>
