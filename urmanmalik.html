			<th>Long before Ferguson burst onto the scene as<br>
			an express pacer, it was his battles with his<br>
			brother that shaped his love for fast bowling.<br>
			Their jousts in the car park, and the urge to<br>
			be better than his older brother, is what put <br>
			him on track to pick up pace bowling. "A spray gun<br>
			," is how Mitch Ferguson describes the <br>
			early days of Lockie . "But at least he could <br>
			bowl fast."</th>

			<th>When Lockie turned up for Auckland Aces<br>
			for th first time , he made some of the <br>
			international players look clueless. Jacob<br>
			Oram was one of them . The dream to play for<br>
			New Zealand came with its own challenges .<br>
			Tim Southee and Trent Boult up front meant <br>
			he always had to be the third pacer in the <br>
			side. And he's transitioned into a middle-overs<br>
			enforcer because of his ability to force batters <br>
			into making errors even with an old ball in <br>
			hand.</th>
